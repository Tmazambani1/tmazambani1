As a coding boot camp graduate skilled in Java, SQL, Python, HTML, and CSS, I'm ready to tackle complex challenges in tech. I thrive on problem-solving and possess a strong foundation in multiple programming languages. My goal is to make an impact and grow as a programmer while collaborating with others who share my passion for technology.
